This is an app created for the  #7DaysofCodeChallenge 
# Journal App

This project applies what was taught in the Google Africa Challenge Scholarship. I used Clean architecture, 
using MVVM. I created custom call backs for some of the tasks as well as implementing a few 
Espresso ui tests.

I implemented the repository pattern adding, editing, and deleting data to both a local and remote database using FireStore.
I integrated LiveData and Room for the local repository.

I added an item selector and followed material design principles.
There is a lot more that could be done to improve this project but it is what I was able to put together in the time given.
I have learnt a lot from doing this and can see the power in architectural components.
I would definitley use the data binding library in the future.
The learning continues.
